This code is underneath my personal website at https://galonpy.github.io/

I have built this kind of website in roughly three days for myself and clients. I did not have prior knowledge of front-end, HTML, Javascript, or CSS. I adapted it from al-folio starter code that relies on Jekyll, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
